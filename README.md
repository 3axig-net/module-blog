## Why add a blog to Magento instead of using WordPress?

Many eCommerce stores, including Magento, run blogs on separate platforms like WordPress. While that may seem convenient, it often creates:

* SEO authority split between your store and a blog
* Complicated integrations
* Tracking inconsistencies
* Performance issues
* Security risks from additional platforms

A native Magento 2 blog keeps everything under one domain, one system, and one SEO strategy.

Magefan Blog Extension for Magento allows you to create content directly inside Magento, which strengthens domain authority and allows you to keep full control over content, design, performance, and analytics.
